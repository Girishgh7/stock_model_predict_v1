# Open-Source License Agreement

**Preamble:**
This code is written by Girish GH, who has taken inspiration from the real world, the web, or guidance from others. The code may seem to have similarities to some popular YouTube videos; it may be due to these videos being one of my inspirations or because I have followed the YouTube video. The code which I have written can be used for your personal use (after giving required credits), but copy-pasting isn't allowed. The code uploaded to GitHub is for my personal records, hence proper documentation might not be present. Do note that.
